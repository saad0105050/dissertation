As we have outlined before, 
if slot $t$ in a characteristic string $w$ 
has the Unique Vertex Property (UVP) 
then the slots $s = 1, \ldots, t$ 
are settled in every fork for $w$. 
Our current goal is to 
characterize when a slot has the UVP. 
(In \Section~\ref{sec:fork-framework}, we show an alternative way 
to characterize the UVP; see Lemma~\ref{lemma:uvp-margin}.) 
% When the symbols in $w$ are independent and identically distributed, 
% this alternate characterization allows us to explicitly compute 
% the probability that a given slot has the UVP in $w$.)

We start with laying down some structural properties of forks. 
Next, we define the so-called Catalan slots 
and show that if a slot is Catalan then \emph{in every fork}, all sufficiently long blockchains must contain a block from that slot. 
Next, we show that this implication is actually an equivalence. 
Finally, 
we revisit the above implication assuming 
that the honest players use a consistent longest-chain tie-breaking rule.
