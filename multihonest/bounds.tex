In \Section~\ref{sec:catalan}, 
we explored the structural connection 
between the UVP and Catalan slots. 
In this section, we present a bound (Bound~\ref{bound:unique-honest-catalan}) 
on the stochastic event that ``a uniquely honest Catalan slot appears frequently;'' 
it complements Theorem~\ref{thm:unique-honest}. 
(Later, in \Section~\ref{sec:lcr-tie-multihonest}, 
we prove a similar bound, Bound~\ref{bound:two-catalans}, 
which concerns two consecutive Catalan slots and complements Theorem~\ref{thm:multiple-honest}.)
We defer the proof of Bound~\ref{bound:unique-honest-catalan} till \Section~\ref{sec:estimates-multihonest}
and proceed, instead, to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:main-mh} below.

% As we shall see, 
% the main theorems follow easily from these connections. 


Recall the $(\epsilon, p_\h)$-Bernoulli condition from~\ref{def:bernoulli-cond}.
\begin{bound}\label{bound:unique-honest-catalan}
  Let $T, s, k \in \NN, T \geq s + k$ and  $\epsilon, q_\h \in (0, 1)$. 
  Let $w$ be a characteristic string satisfying 
  the $(\epsilon, q_\h)$-Bernoulli condition 
  and let $y = w_s \ldots w_{s+k-1}$.
  Then 
  \[
    \Pr_w[\text{$w$ does not contain a uniquely honest Catalan slot in $y$}]  
      \leq 
      \exp\left(
        -k\cdot \Omega(\min(\epsilon^3, \epsilon^2 q_\h)) 
      \right)
      \,.
  \]
\end{bound}
In particular, 
% when $q_\H = 0$, 
when $q_\h = (1+\epsilon)/2$, 
the bound above coincides with the 
bound in~\citet{LinearConsistency}. 
Combined with the stochastic dominance argument in Lemma~\ref{lemma:dominance-martingale}, 
it follows that the result in Theorem~\ref{thm:main-mh} subsumes the result in~\citet{LinearConsistency}.



% \noindent 
% For now, let us defer the proofs of these bounds in Section~\ref{sec:estimates} 
% and prove the main theorems below. 




\Paragraph{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main-mh}.}

  We consider the distribution $\mathcal{B}$ first. 
  Write $w = xyz, |x| = s - 1$.
  Recall that  
  $
    \mathbf{S}^{s,k}[\mathcal{B}] 
    = \Pr_{w \sim \mathcal{B}}[\text{$s$ is not $k$-settled in $w$}]
  $. 
  Theorem~\ref{thm:unique-honest} and Equation~\eqref{eq:settlement-uvp} implies that 
  if $w$ contains a uniquely honest Catalan slot $c \in [s, s + k]$ 
  then slot $s$ must be $k$-settled in $w$. 
  In fact, by virtue of Fact~\ref{fact:catalan-unique-longest}, 
  it suffices to take $c \in [s, s + k - 1]$, 
  i.e., $|x| \leq c \leq |xy|$. 
  Thus the probability above is bounded by 
  Bound~\ref{bound:unique-honest-catalan} 
  which renames $p_\h = q_\h$.
   % and $p_\H = q_\H$. 
  This proves the first inequality. 
  
  Now let us prove the second inequality. 
  % Let $a, b \in \{\h,\H,\A\}^*, |a| = |b|$.
  % Define the partial order $\leq$ on equal-length characteristic strings as follows: 
  % $a \leq b$ if and only if
  % for all $i = 1, \ldots, |a|$, $a_i = 1$ implies $b_i = 1$. 
  For any player playing the settlement game, 
  let $C$ be the set of strings on which the player wins. 
  Clearly, $C$ is monotone 
  with respect to the partial order $\leq$ 
  defined on $\{\h, \H, \A\}^T$ 
  (see the commentary following Definition~\ref{def:dominance-mh}).  
  To see why, note that if the player wins 
  on a specific string $w$, 
  he can certainly win on any string $w^\prime$ so that $w \leq w^\prime$. 
  By assumption, 
  $\mathcal{W} \DominatedBy \mathcal{B}$. 
  % by the definition of $\epsilon$-martingale condition, 
  It follows from Definition~\ref{def:dominance-mh} that 
  $\Pr_{\mathcal{W}}[w] \leq \Pr_{\mathcal{B}}[w]$ 
  for any $w$ in the monotone set $C$. 
  By referring to the definition of settlement insecurity 
  (see Definition~\ref{def:settlement-mh-insecurity}), 
  we conclude that 
  $
    \mathbf{S}^{s,k}[\mathcal{W}] \leq \mathbf{S}^{s,k}[\mathcal{B}]
  $.
  \hfill $\qed$
