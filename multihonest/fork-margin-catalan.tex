In this section, we present the connections between Catalan slots and these elements (namely, the ``relative margin''). 
The exposition culminates in Corollary~\ref{coro:catalan-margin-critical} 
which characterizes a Catalan slot in terms of relative margin. 
This directly connects the consistency analysis in Sleepy~\cite{Sleepy} 
and~\cite{LinearConsistency} through the observations made in this paper.



% \input{reach-and-margin}



% We can define the ``forkability'' of a
% characteristic string in terms of its margin.
% Although this definition is not necessary for our presentation, it
% reflects the terminology of existing literature.

% \begin{definition}[Forkable strings]\label{def:forkable}
%   A charactersitic string $w$ is \emph{forkable} if its margin is non-negative, i.e., $\mu(w) \geq 0$.
%   Equivalently, $w$ is forkable if there is a balanced fork for $w$.

\subsection{Catalan slots and relative margin}

  Below, we lay down the connection between Catalan slots 
  and relative margin.
