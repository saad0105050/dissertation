\section{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:minentropy-loss-praos-single-epoch}}
Let $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and $\alpha = (1-\epsilon)/2$ be the adversarial stake.
Suppose that $\Blockchain$ is $(\EpsP, k, s)$-secure in an epoch 
where first $n$ slots, 
which correspond to a characteristic string $W \sim \mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$, 
contribute to the beacon output.
Recall $g(n,\epsilon)$ defined in ~\eqref{eq:praos-gneps}.
Using Lemma~\ref{lemma:grinding-praos-second-moment} and~\ref{lemma:praos-tail-gamma}, 
we can see that except with probability $2\EpsP$, $g(n,\epsilon)$ is at most $\sqrt{m/\EpsP}$ 
where $m$ is the right-hand-side of~\eqref{eq:grinding-praos-second-moment}.

\section{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:minentropy-loss-praos-multi-epochs}}\label{sec:thm-praos-multiepoch}\label{sec:proof-praos-theorem}

Let $W \sim \mathcal{L}_n(\alpha)$. 
Let $E_p$ be the event that 
$\Blockchain$ is not $(\EpsP, k, s)$-secure during 
the first $n$ slots in an epoch. 
Let $M$ be an upper bound on the second moment of $g$, 
conditioned on $\overline{E}$. 
Let $\gamma \geq (M/\EpsP)^{1/2}$. 
Let $E_g$ be the event that $g(W)$ is more than $\gamma$.
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:grinding-praos-second-moment}, 
$\Pr[g(W) \geq \gamma] \leq 2 \EpsP$. 
Note that the min-entropy loss in the beacon is at most 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:log-gamma}
 \log_2(\gamma) 
 = 1/2 \cdot [\log_2(M) + \log_2(1/\EpsP)]
 = \log_2(\sqrt{M}) + \log_2(1/\sqrt{\EpsP})
 \,. 
\end{equation}


Condition on the event that neither $E_p$ nor $E_g$ 
occurs during the first $L$ epochs. 
This means, in any of the $L$ epochs, 
the adversary can inflate the failure probability 
by at most a factor of $\gamma$.
The total bad probability after $L$ epochs is
$$
  p
  \leq L (2 \EpsP + \gamma \EpsP)
  = L (2 \EpsP + M^{1/2} \sqrt{\EpsP})
  \,.
$$

Since $\epsilon > 0.809$, we refer to \eqref{eq:V-eps-praos} 
and the statement of the theorem immediately follows.

The only missing pieces are 
the proofs of Claims~\ref{claim:multiple-honest-blocks},~\ref{claim:t1star-variance-exact}, 
and~\ref{claim:t2star-variance-exact}; 
These are given in \Section~\ref{sec:praos-claim-multiple-honest-blocks},~\ref{sec:praos-claim-t1star-variance-exact}, and~\ref{sec:praos-claim-t2star-variance-exact}, respectively.
