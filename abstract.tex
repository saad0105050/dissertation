In the past decade, blockchain technology has emerged as a foundation for a diverse range of distributed applications, notably cryptocurrencies and decentralized ledger. These protocols allow the users -- across the globe and not needing to trust one another -- exchange messages and eventually reach an agreement. 

 

Currently, the most popular blockchain technology is the Proof-of-Work (PoW) paradigm, popularized by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Alternative paradigms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), aim to provide the same functionalities and security as PoW while requiring only a fraction of a PoW network's enormous energy cost. This, however, is non-trivial.

 

In this dissertation, we study the security of PoS blockchains in the eventual consensus model under the so-called longest-chain rule; 
these are also called ``Nakamoto-style PoS.''
\begin{itemize}
  \item We show that the security guarantees 
  for the consistency property of these blockchains are asymptotically similar 
  to those of the Nakamoto-style PoW blockchains (published at ACM SODA 2020). 

  \item We present a security analysis under a simple honest-majority assumption; this is a sweeping improvement over all existing analyses as they needed a stricter honest-majority assumption (accepted at IEEE ICDCS 2020).

  \item We analyze the security of the ``randomness beacon'' of two important protocols: Ouroboros Praos and SnowWhite. Our results demarcate the parameter settings for which these protocols remain secure. 

  \item We also analyze some new, simple, and more secure randomness beacons for eventual consensus PoS.
\end{itemize}

Our results have already made an impact in the industry: \emph{Cardano} -- a leading PoS cryptocurrency -- is using our results and recommendations for designing their protocol.
