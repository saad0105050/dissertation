\section{Nonce leaders and the nonce channel}
Recall the private and public lottery-based leader election schemes 
from Section~\ref{sec:static-dynamic-adversary}. 
Consider a beacon protocol of dimension $\kappa$, 
i.e., one where the initial values and the outputs are $\kappa$-bit Boolean strings. 
Inside an epoch, 
the participants $\Players$ take part in the \emph{nonce leader election}. 
If a player is elected a nonce leader, 
he emits a uniformly random string from $\{0,1\}^\kappa$  
in the \emph{nonce channel}. 

\begin{definition}[Nonce channel with parameter $k \in \NN$]\label{def:nonce-channel}
  Messages announced in the nonce channel is a tuple $m = (u, x, i, j)$ 
  which reads ``player $u$ is submitting nonce $x$ for slot $i$, 
  and the announcement is made at slot $j$.''
  A nonce message, received at slot $t$, becomes \emph{invalid} 
  if $j > i + k$.
  The nonce channel is a public, immutable ledger: 
  once a valid nonce is announced in this channel, 
  it remains there forever. 
\end{definition}
\noindent
The basic property that we seek from the nonce channel is that 
honest nonces are never lost. 


Notice that the nonce channel can be implemented 
on top of a blockchain protocol $\Blockchain$ 
and mechanisms such as ``input endorsers'' in Ouroboros~\cite{Ouroboros} 
or ``fruits'' in Fruitchain or SnowWhite~\cite{Fruitchains,SnowWhite}.
Here is an example: 
Suppose $\Blockchain$ has the $\sECQ$ property and $\kSlotCP$ property. 
(The validity parameter $k$ in the nonce channel of $\Pi_\Beacon$ 
must match the consistency parameter $k$ in $\Blockchain$.)
Then
\begin{itemize}
  \item A nonce leader in $\Pi_\Beacon$ asks to record his nonce message on $\Blockchain$.
  This announcement is seen (and remembered) by all honest observers in $\Pi_\Beacon$.
  
  \item Suppose an honest observer finds that a valid nonce message he had previously received, 
  does not appear in the ledger implemented by $\Blockchain$. 
  Then he re-announces this message with a proof of this re-announcement.

  \item Eventually, by the persistence guarantee of $\Blockchain$, 
  this message gets recorded in the ledger.
\end{itemize}

\section{New beacon protocols}




\begin{definition}[$(T, k, s, d, \LeaderElection,\EpsP)$-Beacon]
  Let $T, k, s,d \in \NN$ and $\EpsP \in (0,1)$ 
  so that $k$ divides $T$.
  Let $\LeaderElection$ be a given leader election mechanism 
  (see Section~\ref{sec:leader-election-public-private}).
  Let $\Blockchain$ be an $(\EpsP, k, s)$-secure blockchain protocol 
  with epoch length at least $T + s + k$. 
  Consider the following simple beacon protocol on $\{0,1\}^\kappa$ 
  that takes place inside every epoch of $\Blockchain$. 
  $\Pi_\Beacon$ operates inside an epoch of $\Blockchain$ 
  and it computes a function 
  $\Pi_\Beacon : \{0,1\}^\kappa \rightarrow \{0,1\}^\kappa$. 
  Given an initial value $x$ before an epoch, 
  it outputs $\Pi_\Beacon(x)$ 
  after the epoch, as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The first $T$ slots of the epoch participate in $\Pi_\Beacon$. 
    Of these, only one in every $d$ slots is a \emph{nonce-emitting slot}. 

    \item In a nonce-emitting slot, one or more players are elected as a \emph{nonce leader} 
    according to the leader election mechanism $\LeaderElection$.
    A nonce leader announces a uniformly random $\kappa$-bit Boolean string, 
    called a \emph{nonce},  
    in the nonce channel (which has parameter $k$). 

    \item 
    Let $S$ be the set of all nonce-emitting slots in epoch $t$.
    After th epoch is finished, the output $\eta$ is calculated as follows:
    Let $C_i$ be the set of valid nonces recorded from slot $i$ in this epoch. 
    Let $y_i$ be the lexicographically smallest item in $C_i$.
    Finally, we set $\Pi_\Beacon(x) = x \oplus_{i \in S} y_s$.
  \end{itemize}
  Let $\eta_0$ be a uniformly random string in $\{0,1\}^\kappa$. 
  When the beacon is executed for $L$ epochs, 
  the output is a sequential composition of 
  $L$ independent instances of $\Pi_\Beacon$; 
  the output of after epoch $t$ is the initial value used in epoch $(t+1)$. 
  Specifically, 
  the beacon output for epoch $t \in [L]$ is 
  \begin{align}\label{eq:beacon-iterated}
    \eta_t = \Pi_\Beacon(\eta_{t-1}) = \Pi_\Beacon^t(\eta_0)\,.
  \end{align}
\end{definition}


\section{Guarantees against a static adversary}

Let $\alpha \in (0, 1/2), \EpsP \in (0, 1)$ and $T, k, s, d \in \NN$.
Suppose the above parameters satisfy 
\begin{align}\label{eq:alphatothen-epsp}
  \alpha^{(T-k)/d} \leq \EpsP
  \,.
\end{align}
Define 
\begin{align}
  f(\alpha)&= 1/\log_2(1/\alpha)\,, \label{eq:f-bernoulli} \\
  \rho &= \frac{k}{d} + 1 + f(\alpha) \log_2 \left(\frac{T-k}{d (1+\alpha) \EpsP } \right)
  \,. \label{eq:rho-bernoulli}
\end{align}

\begin{theorem}[Static adversary, single epoch]\label{thm:beacon-bernoulli-single-epoch}

  Let $f(\alpha)$ and $\rho$ be as in \eqref{eq:f-bernoulli} and \eqref{eq:rho-bernoulli}.
  Let $\Pi_\Beacon$ be a $(T,k,s,d,\PublicLeaderElection(\alpha), \EpsP)$-beacon.
  Let $\eta$ be the beacon output after the first epoch. 
  Then 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:security-bernoulli-single-epoch}
    \Pr_{\PublicLeaderElection{\alpha}}\left[\MinEntropy(\eta) \geq \kappa - \rho \right] \geq 1 - 3 \EpsP
    \,.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Static adversary, multiple epochs]\label{thm:beacon-bernoulli-multi-epoch}
  Let $\alpha \in (0, 0.41)$ and suppose it satisfies \eqref{eq:alphatothen-epsp}.
  Let $f(\alpha)$ and $\rho$ be as in \eqref{eq:f-bernoulli} and \eqref{eq:rho-bernoulli}.
  Let $\Pi_\Beacon$ be a $(T,k,s,d,\PublicLeaderElection(\alpha), \EpsP)$-beacon.
  Let $\eta$ be the beacon output after $L$ epochs. 
  Then 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:security-bernoulli-multi-epoch}
    \Pr_{\PublicLeaderElection{\alpha}}\left[\MinEntropy(\eta) \geq \kappa - \rho \right] 
      \geq 1 - 3 L
        2^{(k/d) + 1}
        \left( \frac{T-k}{d(1+\alpha)}\right)^{f(\alpha)}
        \EpsP^{1-f(\alpha)}
    \,.

\section{Guarantees against an adaptive adversary}

Let $\alpha \in (0, 1/2), \EpsP \in (0, 1)$ and $T, k, s \in \NN$.
Define 
\begin{align}
    d &= \lfloor (T - k) \log_2(1/\alpha)/\log_2(1/\EpsP)\rfloor \label{eq:d-multiepoch}\\
    f(\alpha) &= \log_2(1 + 3 \alpha + \alpha^2)/\log_2(1/\alpha) \label{eq:f-poisson} \\
  \rho &= 
      \frac{k}{2 d} \log_2(1+3\alpha+\alpha^2) 
      % \log_2(1/\EpsP) \cdot \frac{k f(\alpha)}{2(T-k)} 
      + \begin{cases}
     \frac{1}{2} \log_2 \left[ \frac{((T-k)/d)^3}{(1+\alpha) \EpsP } \right] 
      & \quad\text{if $\alpha \leq 0.41$}\,, \\
     \frac{f(\alpha)}{2} \log_2 \left(\frac{((T-k)/d)^{1 + 2/f(\alpha)} }{(1+\alpha) \EpsP} \right) 
      &\quad\text{otherwise\,.}\label{eq:rho-poisson}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}


\begin{theorem}[Adaptive adversary, single epoch]\label{thm:beacon-poisson-single-epoch}
  Let $\alpha \in (0, 0.41)$ and suppose it satisfies \eqref{eq:alphatothen-epsp}.
  Let $f(\alpha)$ and $\rho$ be as in \eqref{eq:f-poisson} and \eqref{eq:rho-poisson}.
  Let $\Pi_\Beacon$ be a $(T,k,s,d,\PrivateLeaderElection(\alpha), \EpsP)$-beacon 
  where $d$ is from~\eqref{eq:d-multiepoch}.
  Let $\eta$ be the beacon output after the first epoch. 
  Then 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:security-bernoulli-single-epoch}
    \Pr_{\PrivateLeaderElection{\alpha}}\left[\MinEntropy(\eta) \geq \kappa - \rho \right] \geq 1 - 3 \EpsP
    \,.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}



\begin{theorem}[Adaptive adversary, multiple epochs]\label{thm:beacon-poisson-multi-epoch}
  Let $\alpha \in (0, 0.41), \EpsP \in (0,1)$, 
  $d$ as in~\eqref{eq:d-multiepoch}, 
  and suppose that \eqref{eq:alphatothen-epsp} is satisfied with $n = (T-k)/d$.
  % Let $\alpha \in (0, 0.41)$ and $T, s, k, \EpsP, L$ as above. 
  % Let $\lambda$ be defined in~\eqref{eq:lambda-star-poisson} and 
  % let $\gamma$ be defined in~\eqref{eq:xor-poisson-tail-gamma}. 
  Let $f(\alpha)$ and $\rho$ be as in \eqref{eq:f-poisson} and \eqref{eq:rho-poisson}.
  Let $\Pi_\Beacon$ be a $(T,k,s,d,\PrivateLeaderElection(\alpha), \EpsP)$-beacon.
  Let $\eta$ be the beacon output after $L$ epochs. 
  Then 
  $$
    \Pr_{\PrivateLeaderElection{\alpha}}[\MinEntropy(\eta) \geq \kappa - \rho ] \geq 
      % 1 -  3 L (T - k)^{3/2} \EpsP^{ (1/2) \cdot \left( 1 - f(\alpha)k/(T-k) \right)}
      1 - 3 L (T - k)^{3/2} \EpsP^{1/2 - (k/(T-k)) f(\alpha)/2}
    \,.
  $$
  % Here, the probability is taken according to $\PrivateLeaderElection(\alpha)$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent
