Recall that in Part~\ref{part:praos}, 
we analyzed the randomness beacon in Ouroboros Praos\cite{Praos} and Snow White~\cite{SnowWhite} 
in the synchronous setting. 
We showed 
that the min-entropy loss in the beacon output 
is logarithmic in the security parameter if the adversarial stake is below $9\%$; 
otherwise, it grows linearly in the security parameter.
As Praos is deployed in practice (since August 2020), 
it remains an open question to design simple PoS beacons for Praos 
which can withstand large adversarial stakes.

In this part of the dissertation, 
we present PoS beacons 
whose most salient feature is simplicity and high quality.
In the private leader election setting (e.g., Praos and Snow White), 
our beacon has a superior output quality 
(compared to Praos) 
as long as the adversarial bias is at most $41\%$. 
Although this beacon does not cover adversarial stakes $\alpha$ above $41\%$, 
the regime $\alpha \in (0, 0.41)$ is nonetheless practical: 
for practical values for the consistency parameter $k$, 
Praos' consistency error bound 
starts to degrade when the adversarial stake goes above $40\%$.) 
As an immediate application, it would improve the grinding tolerance in Praos; 
see Figure~\ref{fig:rho-poisson-beacon} for a comparison.

We also design a PoS beacon in the public leader election setting 
which can work with Ouroboros classic~\cite{Ouroboros}. 
Recall that Ouroboros classic uses an MPC-based beacon protocol 
which precludes any grinding. 
Implementing this protocol in practice, however, is not palatable. 
We believe that this beacon will be valuable for 
PoS protocols 
that do not have the means to use/implement the MPC-based beacon 
and, in exchange, are willing to tolerate a very low min-entropy loss 
in the beacon. 
See Figure~\ref{fig:rho-bernoulli-beacon}.
