\section{Publications}
% Everything here is fictitious. Any coincidences in actual publication or author names is entirely unintended
% A tip to list everything easier here is to compile once with pdflatex and then bib so then the .bbl file
% will get generated. Then you can easily find the publication there and copy paste the formatted version here
% I like to bold my name in this type of left so it's clear (and it's a checksum to see if your first author list
% of publications all have you as the first author, and likewise for the coauthorship list
