  It was a dreary, cold, and gray December day. I was staring at a row of books 
  in a dimly lit part of UConn's library. When I picked up \emph{that} book, I didn't 
  know one day I would be writing this acknowledgment in another December morning. 
  Ten years in between.

  Thank you, \emph{Men of Mathematics.} And thank \emph{you}, 
  Euler, Gauss, Galois, and Riemann. If you weren't there, 
  I wouldn't be here.

  Thank you, my friends: Ahsan, Ashik, Redwan, Saikat, Shafiul, Kaptan, Kajal, and Mahadi. 
  You have made me \emph{me} over the years. For good or for bad.

  Thank you, Saiful vai, Shakil vai, Fahim, Lazin, Nafis, Anik, and Nisha. 
  It's been a pleasure to have you in my life.

  Thank you, my teachers: Swapan Dhar Sir, Deepak Sir, Selina Madam, Asaduzzaman Sir, Mushfiq Sir, Hossain Sir, and Vutto Sir. 

  Thank you, Hajan Uncle. You didn't flinch when you gave my dad the hefty money 
  needed for my I-20 at UConn. He didn't even have to ask.

  Thank you, Panna Uncle, Beauty Bouma, Kabir Uncle, Prova Chachi, Jewel Fufi, and Kowel Fufi. 
  It is your love that doesn't let me age.

  Thank you, Bubu.

  Thank you, Tayeeb. I was able to do this Ph.D. because you were there back with my mum and dad.

  Thank you, Lara, Joy, Rebecca, Debra, and Howard! I didn't realize that we've been here for a decade. 
  I loved to bug you guys at the department office. 

  Thank you, Sarah, Luke, Jordan, Sanjiv, Eli, Gang, and Saurav. I'll always cherish your company.

  Thank you, Sadia, Shinjon, and Saba. You've made me so happy just by being who you are. 

  Thank you, \emph{Baba!} You've always expected great things from me. You are \emph{the} 
  most compassionate man I've known. 

  Thank you, \emph{Ma!} You've sacrificed your life for me. Every moment that I feel happy, 
  every place that I go, everything that I do --- it is made possible by you. 

  Thank you, Cris (Moore), Aggelos (Kiayias), Peter (Ga\v{z}i), Ravi (Sundaram), Don (Sheehy), 
  Ion (Mandoiu), Raj (Sanguthevar Rajasekaran), and Maifi (Hasan Khan). 
  It was (is) an honor to have spent time with you.

  Thank you, my Ph.D. committee members, Ben (Dr. Benjamin Fuller) 
  and Walter (Dr. Walter Krawec). 
  You have trusted me and helped me grow. 
  Ben, you are by far the most awesome classroom teacher I've seen. 

  The Sanskrit word \emph{Dvija} is a euphemism for a Brahmin priest. 
  Literally, it means ``twice born.'' 
  Professor Russell, I've been twice born since I've been with you. 
  You trusted me, let me make mistakes, never flinched, never doubted, 
  never frowned. You made me feel that I'm walking the same path that Riemann had walked before, 
  but it's taking a bit longer because, well, there's no shame if you can't be Riemann. 
  You gave me time, oh how sorely did I need that. 
  You've taken care of me. 
  Ever since I knew you, I wanted to be like you. I still do. I always will. 
  You've given a richness to my life you'll never know.
  I hope I'll grow to be worth the unconditional love, patience, and respect you've given me. One day. 
  And, \emph{thank you.}

  And then there's you, Mukti. 
  This dissertation is written with the ink of your tears, 
  your agonies, your sacrifices, your patience, your blood. 
  But it is also written with the joys we've shared, 
  the placed we'd been together, 
  the bison that walked past us, 
  the stars that shone upon us beneath the Nevada desert sky, 
  and the time you got lost in the Adirondack woods after dark.
  I've been so happy to be with you 
  that I didn't notice that you are brightening my life 
  like a candle does. 
  I would never have been able to finish up this Ph.D. had it not been for you. 
  You've sacrificed your life, your career, and your time for me. 
  You are girl with a big big heart. 
  
  Thank you, Mukti. 
  This dissertation I dedicate to you.
