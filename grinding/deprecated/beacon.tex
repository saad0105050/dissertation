\subsection{A randomness beacon from coin-tossing}
Now we are poised to construct a distributed randomness beacon protocol $\Beacon$ 
by harnessing an existing blockchain protocol $\Protocol$ 
which satisfies the axioms in Section~\ref{sec:model}. 
Under the hood, the beacon protocol will implement a composition of XOR target games 
(cf. Theorem~\ref{thm:xor-game-beacon}) bootstrapped with a fresh random string. 

How good is this beacon?
As we have proved in Theorem~\ref{thm:xor-game-beacon}, 
the min-entropy of the random strings generated in this composition 
is ``large,'' giving a quantified bound for the bias-resistance property of the beacon. 
Moreover, the agreement, fairness, and public-verifiability properties of the beacon 
are easily implied by the blockchain axioms in Section~\ref{sec:model}. 
Finally, the unpredictability of the beacon stems from 
the assumption in Lemma~\ref{lemma:composition} that in each instance of the XOR target game, 
at least one nonce set is empty. 
Hence at least one of operands in the XOR operation is uniform, making the beacon output 
uniform as well.

Without any further ado, let us present our beacon protocol which is followed by 
rigorous argument about its properties and parameters.
